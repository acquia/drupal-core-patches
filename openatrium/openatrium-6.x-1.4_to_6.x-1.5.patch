-
-              Version 2, June 1991
-
-Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc. 675 Mass Ave,
-Cambridge, MA 02139, USA. Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute
-verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
-
-                  Preamble
-
-The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to
-share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is
-intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to
-make sure the software is free for all its users. This General Public License
-applies to most of the Free Software Foundation's software and to any other
-program whose authors commit to using it. (Some other Free Software
-Foundation software is covered by the GNU Library General Public License
-instead.) You can apply it to your programs, too.
-
-When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our
-General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the
-freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if
-you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you
-can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that
-you know you can do these things.
-
-To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to
-deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These restrictions
-translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the
-software, or if you modify it.
-
-For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for
-a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have. You must make
-sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must show
-them these terms so they know their rights.
-
-We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2)
-offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute
-and/or modify the software.
-
-Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain that
-everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free software. If the
-software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients
-to know that what they have is not the original, so that any problems
-introduced by others will not reflect on the original authors' reputations.
-
-Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents. We
-wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will individually
-obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program proprietary. To prevent
-this, we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's
-free use or not licensed at all.
-
-The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification
-follow.
-
-           GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
- TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND
-               MODIFICATION
-
-0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice
-placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms
-of this General Public License. The "Program", below, refers to any such
-program or work, and a "work based on the Program" means either the
-Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work
-containing the Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with
-modifications and/or translated into another language. (Hereinafter, translation
-is included without limitation in the term "modification".) Each licensee is
-addressed as "you".
-
-Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered
-by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running the Program is
-not restricted, and the output from the Program is covered only if its contents
-constitute a work based on the Program (independent of having been made
-by running the Program). Whether that is true depends on what the Program
-does.
-
-1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source
-code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
-appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and
-disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License
-and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of the
-Program a copy of this License along with the Program.
-
-You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you
-may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
-
-2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it,
-thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such
-modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you
-also meet all of these conditions:
-
-a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that
-you changed the files and the date of any change.
-
-b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or in
-part contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof, to be
-licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this
-License.
-
-c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run,
-you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the most
-ordinary way, to print or display an announcement including an appropriate
-copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that
-you provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
-these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this License.
-(Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does not normally print such
-an announcement, your work based on the Program is not required to print
-an announcement.)
-
-These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable
-sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and can be
-reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then
-this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute
-them as separate works. But when you distribute the same sections as part
-of a whole which is a work based on the Program, the distribution of the
-whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other
-licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part
-regardless of who wrote it.
-
-Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to
-work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to
-control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the
-Program.

+
+                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
+   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
+
+  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains
+a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
+under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,
+refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"
+means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
+that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
+either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
+language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
+the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".
+
+Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
+covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
+running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
+is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
+Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
+Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.
+
+  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
+source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
+conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
+copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
+notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
+and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
+along with the Program.
+
+You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
+you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
+
+  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
+of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
+distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
+above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
+
+    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
+    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
+
+    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
+    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
+    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
+    parties under the terms of this License.
+
+    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
+    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
+    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
+    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
+    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
+    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
+    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
+    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
+    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
+    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)
+
+These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
+identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
+and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
+themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
+sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
+distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
+on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
+this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
+entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
+
+Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
+your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
+exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
+collective works based on the Program.
 
 In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
-with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a
-storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope
-of this License.
-
-3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under
-Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1
-and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:
-
-a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source
-code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above
-on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
-
-b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give
-any third party, for a charge no more than your cost of physically performing
-source distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of the corresponding
-source code, to be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on
-a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
-
-c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to distribute
-corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed only for
-noncommercial distribution and only if you received the program in object
-code or executable form with such an offer, in accord with Subsection b
-above.)
+with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
+a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
+the scope of this License.
+
+  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
+under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
+Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:
+
+    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
+    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
+    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
+
+    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
+    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
+    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
+    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
+    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
+    customarily used for software interchange; or,
+
+    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
+    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
+    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
+    received the program in object code or executable form with such
+    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)
 
 The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
-making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code
-means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated
-interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and
-installation of the executable. However, as a special exception, the source
-code distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in
-either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel,
-and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that
-component itself accompanies the executable.
-
-If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access to
-copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the
-source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source code,
-even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the
-object code.
-
-4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as
-expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy,
-modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically
-terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received
-copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
-terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.
-
-5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it.
-However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the
-Program or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you
-do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the
-Program (or any work based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance
-of this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying,
-distributing or modifying the Program or works based on it.
-
-6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
-Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original
-licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms and
-conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients'
-exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing
-compliance by third parties to this License.
-
-7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
-infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions
-are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that
-contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the
-conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy
-simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent
-obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Program at all.
-For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution
-of the Program by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through
-you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
+making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
+code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
+associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
+control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a
+special exception, the source code distributed need not include
+anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
+form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
+operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
+itself accompanies the executable.
+
+If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
+access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
+access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
+distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
+compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
+
+  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
+except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
+otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
+void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
+However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
+this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
+parties remain in full compliance.
+
+  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
+signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
+distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
+prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
+modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
+Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
+all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
+the Program or works based on it.
+
+  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
+Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
+original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
+these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
+restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
+You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
+this License.
+
+  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
+infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
+conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
+otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
+excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
+distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
+License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
+may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
+license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
+all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
+the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
 refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.
 
-If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
-particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply and
-the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.
-
-It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or
-other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this
-section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software
-distribution system, which is implemented by public license practices. Many
-people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software
-distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
-system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to
-distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose
-that choice.
-
-This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a
-consequence of the rest of this License.
-
-8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in certain
-countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright
-holder who places the Program under this License may add an explicit
-geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that
-distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such
-case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this
-License.
-
-9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
-of the General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be
-similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new
-problems or concerns.
-
-Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies
-a version number of this License which applies to it and "any later version",
-you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that
-version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If
-the Program does not specify a version number of this License, you may
-choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.
-
-10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs
-whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author to ask for
-permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software
-Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make
-exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of
-preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of
-promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.
-
-               NO WARRANTY
-
-11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE,
-THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT
-PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE
-STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
-OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT
-WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED,
-INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES
-OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
-PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND
-PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE
-PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL
-NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
-
-12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR
-AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR
-ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
-REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE
-LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL,
-SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES
-ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE
-PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA
-OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES
-SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE
-PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN
-IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF
-THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
-
-          END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

+                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
+
+            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
+
+  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
+possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
+free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.
+
+  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
+to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
+convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
+the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
+
+    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
+    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>
+
+    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
+    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
+    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
+    (at your option) any later version.
+
+    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
+    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
+    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
+    GNU General Public License for more details.
+
+    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along
+    with this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc.,
+    51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA.
+
+Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
+
+If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
+when it starts in an interactive mode:
+
+    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author
+    Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
+    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
+    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.
+
+The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate
+parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may
+be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be
+mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.
+
+You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
+school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
+necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:
+
+  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program
+  `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.
+
+  <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1989
+  Ty Coon, President of Vice
+
+This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into
+proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may
+consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the
+library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General
+Public License instead of this License.

-
-Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc. 675 Mass Ave,
-Cambridge, MA 02139, USA. Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute
-verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
-
-                  Preamble
-
-The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to
-share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is
-intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to
-make sure the software is free for all its users. This General Public License
-applies to most of the Free Software Foundation's software and to any other
-program whose authors commit to using it. (Some other Free Software
-Foundation software is covered by the GNU Library General Public License
-instead.) You can apply it to your programs, too.
-
-When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our
-General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the
-freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if
-you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you
-can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that
-you know you can do these things.
-
-To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to
-deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These restrictions
-translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the
-software, or if you modify it.
-
-For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for
-a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have. You must make
-sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must show
-them these terms so they know their rights.
-
-We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2)
-offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute
-and/or modify the software.
-
-Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain that
-everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free software. If the
-software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients
-to know that what they have is not the original, so that any problems
-introduced by others will not reflect on the original authors' reputations.
-
-Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents. We
-wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will individually
-obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program proprietary. To prevent
-this, we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's
-free use or not licensed at all.
-
-The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification
-follow.
-
-           GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
- TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND
-               MODIFICATION
-
-0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice
-placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms
-of this General Public License. The "Program", below, refers to any such
-program or work, and a "work based on the Program" means either the
-Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work
-containing the Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with
-modifications and/or translated into another language. (Hereinafter, translation
-is included without limitation in the term "modification".) Each licensee is
-addressed as "you".
-
-Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered
-by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running the Program is
-not restricted, and the output from the Program is covered only if its contents
-constitute a work based on the Program (independent of having been made
-by running the Program). Whether that is true depends on what the Program
-does.
-
-1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source
-code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
-appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and
-disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License
-and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of the
-Program a copy of this License along with the Program.
-
-You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you
-may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
-
-2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it,
-thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such
-modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you
-also meet all of these conditions:
-
-a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that
-you changed the files and the date of any change.
-
-b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or in
-part contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof, to be
-licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this
-License.
-
-c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run,
-you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the most
-ordinary way, to print or display an announcement including an appropriate
-copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that
-you provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
-these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this License.
-(Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does not normally print such
-an announcement, your work based on the Program is not required to print
-an announcement.)
-
-These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable
-sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and can be
-reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then
-this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute
-them as separate works. But when you distribute the same sections as part
-of a whole which is a work based on the Program, the distribution of the
-whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other
-licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part
-regardless of who wrote it.
-
-Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to
-work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to
-control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the
-Program.

+collective works based on the Program.
 
 In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
-with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a
-storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope

-
-a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source
-code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above
-on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
-
-b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give
-any third party, for a charge no more than your cost of physically performing
-source distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of the corresponding
-source code, to be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on
-a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
-
-c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to distribute
-corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed only for
-noncommercial distribution and only if you received the program in object
-code or executable form with such an offer, in accord with Subsection b
-above.)

-either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel,
-and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that
-component itself accompanies the executable.
-
-If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access to
-copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the
-source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source code,
-even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the
-object code.
-
-4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as
-expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy,
-modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically
-terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received
-copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
-terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.
-
-5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it.
-However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the
-Program or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you
-do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the
-Program (or any work based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance
-of this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying,
-distributing or modifying the Program or works based on it.
-
-6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
-Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original
-licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms and
-conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients'
-exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing
-compliance by third parties to this License.
-
-7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
-infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions
-are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that
-contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the
-conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy
-simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent
-obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Program at all.
-For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution
-of the Program by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through
-you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
+making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
+code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
+associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
+control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a
+special exception, the source code distributed need not include
+anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
+form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
+operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
+itself accompanies the executable.
+
+If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
+access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
+access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
+distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
+compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
+
+  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
+except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
+otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
+void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
+However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
+this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
+parties remain in full compliance.
+
+  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
+signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
+distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
+prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
+modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
+Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
+all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
+the Program or works based on it.
+
+  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
+Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
+original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
+these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
+restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
+You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
+this License.
+
+  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
+infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
+conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
+otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
+excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
+distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
+License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
+may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
+license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
+all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
+the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
 refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.

+
+            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
+
+  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
+possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
+free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.
+
+  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
+to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
+convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
+the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
+
+    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
+    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>
+
+    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
+    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
+    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
+    (at your option) any later version.
+
+    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
+    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
+    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
+    GNU General Public License for more details.
+
+    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along
+    with this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc.,
+    51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA.
+
+Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
+
+If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
+when it starts in an interactive mode:
+
+    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author
+    Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
+    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
+    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.
+
+The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate
+parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may
+be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be
+mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.
+
+You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
+school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
+necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:
+
+  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program
+  `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.
+
+  <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1989
+  Ty Coon, President of Vice
+
+This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into
+proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may
+consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the
+library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General
+Public License instead of this License.

-              Version 2, June 1991
-
-Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc. 675 Mass Ave,
-Cambridge, MA 02139, USA. Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute
-verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
-
-                  Preamble
-
-The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to
-share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is
-intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to
-make sure the software is free for all its users. This General Public License
-applies to most of the Free Software Foundation's software and to any other
-program whose authors commit to using it. (Some other Free Software
-Foundation software is covered by the GNU Library General Public License
-instead.) You can apply it to your programs, too.
-
-When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our
-General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the
-freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if
-you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you
-can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that
-you know you can do these things.
-
-To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to
-deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These restrictions
-translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the
-software, or if you modify it.
-
-For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for
-a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have. You must make
-sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must show
-them these terms so they know their rights.
-
-We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2)
-offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute
-and/or modify the software.
-
-Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain that
-everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free software. If the
-software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients
-to know that what they have is not the original, so that any problems
-introduced by others will not reflect on the original authors' reputations.
-
-Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents. We
-wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will individually
-obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program proprietary. To prevent
-this, we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's
-free use or not licensed at all.
-
-The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification
-follow.
-
-           GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
- TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND
-               MODIFICATION
-
-0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice
-placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms
-of this General Public License. The "Program", below, refers to any such
-program or work, and a "work based on the Program" means either the
-Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work
-containing the Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with
-modifications and/or translated into another language. (Hereinafter, translation
-is included without limitation in the term "modification".) Each licensee is
-addressed as "you".
-
-Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered
-by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running the Program is
-not restricted, and the output from the Program is covered only if its contents
-constitute a work based on the Program (independent of having been made
-by running the Program). Whether that is true depends on what the Program
-does.
-
-1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source
-code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
-appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and
-disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License
-and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of the
-Program a copy of this License along with the Program.
-
-You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you
-may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
-
-2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it,
-thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such
-modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you
-also meet all of these conditions:
-
-a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that
-you changed the files and the date of any change.
-
-b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or in
-part contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof, to be
-licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this
-License.
-
-c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run,
-you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the most
-ordinary way, to print or display an announcement including an appropriate
-copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that
-you provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
-these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this License.
-(Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does not normally print such
-an announcement, your work based on the Program is not required to print
-an announcement.)
-
-These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable
-sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and can be
-reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then
-this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute
-them as separate works. But when you distribute the same sections as part
-of a whole which is a work based on the Program, the distribution of the
-whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other
-licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part
-regardless of who wrote it.
-
-Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to
-work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to
-control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the
-Program.

+  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
+patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
+program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
+program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
+patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.
+
+  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
+modification follow.
+
+                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
+   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
+
+  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains
+a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
+under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,
+refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"
+means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
+that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
+either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
+language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
+the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".
+
+Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
+covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
+running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
+is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
+Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
+Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.
+
+  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
+source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
+conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
+copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
+notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
+and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
+along with the Program.
+
+You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
+you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
+
+  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
+of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
+distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
+above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
+
+    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
+    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
+
+    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
+    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
+    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
+    parties under the terms of this License.
+
+    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
+    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
+    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
+    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
+    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
+    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
+    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
+    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
+    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
+    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)
+
+These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
+identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
+and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
+themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
+sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
+distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
+on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
+this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
+entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
+
+Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
+your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
+exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
+collective works based on the Program.
 
 In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
-with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a
-storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope
-of this License.
-
-3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under
-Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1
-and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:
-
-a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source
-code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above
-on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
-
-b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give
-any third party, for a charge no more than your cost of physically performing
-source distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of the corresponding
-source code, to be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on
-a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
-
-c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to distribute
-corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed only for
-noncommercial distribution and only if you received the program in object
-code or executable form with such an offer, in accord with Subsection b
-above.)
+with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
+a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
+the scope of this License.
+
+  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
+under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
+Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:
+
+    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
+    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
+    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
+
+    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
+    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
+    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
+    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
+    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
+    customarily used for software interchange; or,
+
+    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
+    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
+    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
+    received the program in object code or executable form with such
+    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)
 
 The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
-making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code
-means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated
-interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and
-installation of the executable. However, as a special exception, the source
-code distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in
-either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel,
-and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that
-component itself accompanies the executable.
-
-If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access to
-copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the
-source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source code,
-even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the
-object code.
-
-4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as
-expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy,
-modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically
-terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received
-copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
-terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.
-
-5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it.
-However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the
-Program or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you
-do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the
-Program (or any work based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance
-of this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying,
-distributing or modifying the Program or works based on it.
-
-6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
-Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original
-licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms and
-conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients'
-exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing
-compliance by third parties to this License.
-
-7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
-infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions
-are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that
-contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the
-conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy
-simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent
-obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Program at all.
-For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution
-of the Program by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through
-you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
+making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
+code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
+associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
+control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a
+special exception, the source code distributed need not include
+anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
+form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
+operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
+itself accompanies the executable.
+
+If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
+access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
+access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
+distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
+compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
+
+  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
+except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
+otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
+void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
+However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
+this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
+parties remain in full compliance.
+
+  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
+signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
+distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
+prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
+modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
+Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
+all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
+the Program or works based on it.
+
+  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
+Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
+original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
+these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
+restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
+You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
+this License.
+
+  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
+infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
+conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
+otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
+excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
+distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
+License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
+may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
+license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
+all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
+the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
 refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.
 
-If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
-particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply and
-the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.
-
-It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or
-other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this
-section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software
-distribution system, which is implemented by public license practices. Many
-people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software
-distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
-system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to
-distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose
-that choice.
-
-This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a
-consequence of the rest of this License.
-
-8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in certain
-countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright
-holder who places the Program under this License may add an explicit
-geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that
-distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such
-case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this
-License.

-of the General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be

-a version number of this License which applies to it and "any later version",
-you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that
-version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If
-the Program does not specify a version number of this License, you may
-choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.
-
-10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs
-whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author to ask for
-permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software
-Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make
-exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of
-preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of
-promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.
-
-               NO WARRANTY
-
-11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE,
-THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT
-PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE

-WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED,

-OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
-PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND

-
-12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR
-AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR
-ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
-REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE
-LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL,

+
+            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
+
+  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
+possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
+free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.
+
+  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
+to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
+convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
+the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
+
+    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
+    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>
+
+    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
+    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
+    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
+    (at your option) any later version.
+
+    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
+    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
+    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
+    GNU General Public License for more details.
+
+    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along
+    with this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc.,
+    51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA.
+
+Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
+
+If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
+when it starts in an interactive mode:
+
+    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author
+    Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
+    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
+    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.
+
+The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate
+parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may
+be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be
+mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.
+
+You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
+school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
+necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:
+
+  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program
+  `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.
+
+  <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1989
+  Ty Coon, President of Vice
+
+This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into
+proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may
+consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the
+library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General
+Public License instead of this License.

-GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
-
-              Version 2, June 1991
-
-Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc. 675 Mass Ave,
-Cambridge, MA 02139, USA. Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute
-verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
-
-                  Preamble
-
-The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to
-share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is
-intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to
-make sure the software is free for all its users. This General Public License
-applies to most of the Free Software Foundation's software and to any other
-program whose authors commit to using it. (Some other Free Software
-Foundation software is covered by the GNU Library General Public License
-instead.) You can apply it to your programs, too.
-
-When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our
-General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the
-freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if
-you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you
-can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that
-you know you can do these things.
-
-To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to
-deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These restrictions
-translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the
-software, or if you modify it.
-
-For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for
-a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have. You must make
-sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must show
-them these terms so they know their rights.
-
-We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2)
-offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute
-and/or modify the software.
-
-Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain that
-everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free software. If the
-software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients
-to know that what they have is not the original, so that any problems
-introduced by others will not reflect on the original authors' reputations.
-
-Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents. We
-wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will individually
-obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program proprietary. To prevent
-this, we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's
-free use or not licensed at all.
-
-The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification
-follow.
-
-           GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
- TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND
-               MODIFICATION
-
-0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice
-placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms
-of this General Public License. The "Program", below, refers to any such
-program or work, and a "work based on the Program" means either the
-Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work
-containing the Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with
-modifications and/or translated into another language. (Hereinafter, translation
-is included without limitation in the term "modification".) Each licensee is
-addressed as "you".
-
-Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered
-by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running the Program is
-not restricted, and the output from the Program is covered only if its contents
-constitute a work based on the Program (independent of having been made
-by running the Program). Whether that is true depends on what the Program
-does.
-
-1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source
-code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
-appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and
-disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License
-and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of the
-Program a copy of this License along with the Program.
-
-You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you
-may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
-
-2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it,
-thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such
-modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you
-also meet all of these conditions:
-
-a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that
-you changed the files and the date of any change.
-
-b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or in
-part contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof, to be
-licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this
-License.
-
-c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run,
-you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the most
-ordinary way, to print or display an announcement including an appropriate
-copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that
-you provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
-these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this License.
-(Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does not normally print such
-an announcement, your work based on the Program is not required to print
-an announcement.)
-
-These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable
-sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and can be
-reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then
-this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute
-them as separate works. But when you distribute the same sections as part
-of a whole which is a work based on the Program, the distribution of the
-whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other
-licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part

+                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
+                       Version 2, June 1991
+
+ Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.,
+ 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA
+ Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
+ of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
+
+                            Preamble
+
+  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
+freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
+License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
+software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
+General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
+Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
+using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
+the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
+your programs, too.
+
+  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
+price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
+have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
+this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
+if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
+in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.
+
+  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
+anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
+These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
+distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.
+
+  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
+gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
+you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
+source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
+rights.
+
+  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
+(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
+distribute and/or modify the software.
+
+  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
+that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
+software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
+want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
+that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
+authors' reputations.
+
+  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
+patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
+program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
+program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
+patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.
+
+  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
+modification follow.
+
+                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
+   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
+
+  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains
+a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
+under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,
+refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"
+means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
+that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
+either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
+language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
+the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".
+
+Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
+covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
+running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
+is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
+Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
+Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.
+
+  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
+source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
+conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
+copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
+notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
+and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
+along with the Program.
+
+You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
+you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
+
+  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
+of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
+distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
+above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
+
+    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
+    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
+
+    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
+    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
+    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
+    parties under the terms of this License.
+
+    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
+    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
+    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
+    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
+    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
+    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
+    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
+    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
+    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
+    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)
+
+These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
+identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
+and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
+themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
+sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
+distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
+on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
+this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
+entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
+
+Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
+your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
+exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
+collective works based on the Program.
 
 In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
-with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a
-storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope
-of this License.
-
-3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under
-Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1
-and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:
-
-a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source
-code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above
-on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
-
-b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give
-any third party, for a charge no more than your cost of physically performing
-source distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of the corresponding
-source code, to be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on
-a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
-
-c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to distribute
-corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed only for
-noncommercial distribution and only if you received the program in object
-code or executable form with such an offer, in accord with Subsection b
-above.)
+with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
+a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
+the scope of this License.
+
+  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
+under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
+Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:
+
+    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
+    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
+    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
+
+    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
+    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
+    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
+    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
+    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
+    customarily used for software interchange; or,
+
+    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
+    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
+    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
+    received the program in object code or executable form with such
+    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)
 
 The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
-making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code
-means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated
-interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and
-installation of the executable. However, as a special exception, the source
-code distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in
-either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel,
-and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that
-component itself accompanies the executable.
-
-If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access to
-copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the
-source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source code,
-even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the
-object code.
-
-4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as
-expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy,
-modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically
-terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received
-copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
-terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.
-
-5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it.
-However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the
-Program or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you
-do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the
-Program (or any work based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance
-of this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying,
-distributing or modifying the Program or works based on it.
-
-6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
-Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original
-licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms and
-conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients'
-exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing
-compliance by third parties to this License.
-
-7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
-infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions
-are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that
-contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the
-conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy
-simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent
-obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Program at all.
-For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution
-of the Program by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through
-you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
+making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
+code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
+associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
+control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a
+special exception, the source code distributed need not include
+anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
+form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
+operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
+itself accompanies the executable.
+
+If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
+access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
+access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
+distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
+compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
+
+  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
+except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
+otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
+void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
+However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
+this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
+parties remain in full compliance.
+
+  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
+signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
+distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
+prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
+modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
+Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
+all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
+the Program or works based on it.
+
+  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
+Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
+original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
+these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
+restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
+You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
+this License.
+
+  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
+infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
+conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
+otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
+excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
+distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
+License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
+may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
+license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
+all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
+the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
 refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.
 
-If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
-particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply and
-the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.
-
-It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or
-other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this
-section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software
-distribution system, which is implemented by public license practices. Many
-people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software
-distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
-system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to
-distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose
-that choice.
-
-This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a
-consequence of the rest of this License.
-
-8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in certain
-countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright
-holder who places the Program under this License may add an explicit
-geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that
-distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such
-case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this
-License.
-
-9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
-of the General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be
-similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new
-problems or concerns.
-
-Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies
-a version number of this License which applies to it and "any later version",
-you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that
-version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If
-the Program does not specify a version number of this License, you may
-choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.
-
-10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs
-whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author to ask for
-permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software
-Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make
-exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of
-preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of
-promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.
-
-               NO WARRANTY
-
-11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE,
-THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT
-PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE
-STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
-OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT
-WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED,
-INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES
-OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
-PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND
-PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE
-PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL
-NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
-
-12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR
-AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR
-ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
-REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE
-LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL,
-SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES
-ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE
-PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA

+
+            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
+
+  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
+possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
+free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.
+
+  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
+to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
+convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
+the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
+
+    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
+    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>
+
+    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
+    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
+    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
+    (at your option) any later version.
+
+    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
+    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
+    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
+    GNU General Public License for more details.
+
+    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along
+    with this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc.,
+    51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA.
+
+Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
+
+If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
+when it starts in an interactive mode:
+
+    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author
+    Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
+    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
+    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.
+
+The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate
+parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may
+be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be
+mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.
+
+You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
+school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
+necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:
+
+  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program
+  `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.
+
+  <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1989
+  Ty Coon, President of Vice
+
+This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into
+proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may
+consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the
+library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General
+Public License instead of this License.

-
-Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc. 675 Mass Ave,
-Cambridge, MA 02139, USA. Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute
-verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
-
-                  Preamble
-
-The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to
-share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is
-intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to
-make sure the software is free for all its users. This General Public License
-applies to most of the Free Software Foundation's software and to any other
-program whose authors commit to using it. (Some other Free Software
-Foundation software is covered by the GNU Library General Public License
-instead.) You can apply it to your programs, too.
-
-When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our
-General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the
-freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if
-you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you
-can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that
-you know you can do these things.
-
-To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to
-deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These restrictions
-translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the
-software, or if you modify it.
-
-For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for
-a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have. You must make
-sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must show
-them these terms so they know their rights.
-
-We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2)
-offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute
-and/or modify the software.
-
-Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain that
-everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free software. If the
-software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients
-to know that what they have is not the original, so that any problems
-introduced by others will not reflect on the original authors' reputations.
-
-Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents. We
-wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will individually
-obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program proprietary. To prevent
-this, we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's
-free use or not licensed at all.
-
-The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification
-follow.
-
-           GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
- TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND
-               MODIFICATION
-
-0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice
-placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms
-of this General Public License. The "Program", below, refers to any such
-program or work, and a "work based on the Program" means either the
-Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work
-containing the Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with
-modifications and/or translated into another language. (Hereinafter, translation
-is included without limitation in the term "modification".) Each licensee is
-addressed as "you".
-
-Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered
-by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running the Program is
-not restricted, and the output from the Program is covered only if its contents
-constitute a work based on the Program (independent of having been made
-by running the Program). Whether that is true depends on what the Program
-does.
-
-1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source
-code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
-appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and
-disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License
-and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of the
-Program a copy of this License along with the Program.
-
-You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you
-may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
-
-2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it,
-thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such
-modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you
-also meet all of these conditions:
-
-a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that
-you changed the files and the date of any change.
-
-b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or in
-part contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof, to be
-licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this
-License.
-
-c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run,
-you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the most
-ordinary way, to print or display an announcement including an appropriate
-copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that
-you provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
-these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this License.
-(Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does not normally print such
-an announcement, your work based on the Program is not required to print
-an announcement.)
-
-These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable
-sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and can be
-reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then
-this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute
-them as separate works. But when you distribute the same sections as part
-of a whole which is a work based on the Program, the distribution of the
-whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other
-licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part
-regardless of who wrote it.
-
-Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to
-work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to
-control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the
-Program.

+    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
+    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any

+    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively

+on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
+this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
+entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
+
+Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
+your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
+exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
+collective works based on the Program.
 
 In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
-with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a
-storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope
-of this License.
-
-3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under
-Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1
-and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:
-
-a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source
-code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above
-on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
-
-b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give
-any third party, for a charge no more than your cost of physically performing
-source distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of the corresponding
-source code, to be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on
-a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
-
-c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to distribute
-corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed only for
-noncommercial distribution and only if you received the program in object
-code or executable form with such an offer, in accord with Subsection b
-above.)
+with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
+a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
+the scope of this License.
+
+  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
+under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
+Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:
+
+    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
+    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
+    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
+
+    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
+    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
+    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
+    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
+    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
+    customarily used for software interchange; or,
+
+    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
+    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
+    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
+    received the program in object code or executable form with such
+    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)
 
 The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
-making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code
-means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated
-interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and
-installation of the executable. However, as a special exception, the source
-code distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in
-either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel,
-and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that
-component itself accompanies the executable.
-
-If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access to
-copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the
-source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source code,
-even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the
-object code.
-
-4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as
-expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy,
-modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically
-terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received
-copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
-terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.
-
-5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it.
-However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the
-Program or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you
-do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the
-Program (or any work based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance
-of this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying,
-distributing or modifying the Program or works based on it.
-
-6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
-Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original
-licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms and
-conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients'
-exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing
-compliance by third parties to this License.
-
-7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
-infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions
-are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that
-contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the
-conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy
-simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent
-obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Program at all.
-For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution
-of the Program by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through
-you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
+making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
+code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
+associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
+control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a
+special exception, the source code distributed need not include
+anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
+form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
+operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
+itself accompanies the executable.
+
+If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
+access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
+access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
+distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
+compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
+
+  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
+except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
+otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
+void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
+However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
+this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
+parties remain in full compliance.
+
+  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
+signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
+distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
+prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
+modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
+Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
+all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
+the Program or works based on it.
+
+  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
+Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
+original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
+these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
+restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
+You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
+this License.
+
+  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
+infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
+conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
+otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
+excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
+distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
+License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
+may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
+license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
+all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
+the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
 refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.
 
-If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
-particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply and
-the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.
-
-It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or
-other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this
-section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software
-distribution system, which is implemented by public license practices. Many
-people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software
-distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
-system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to
-distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose
-that choice.
-
-This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a
-consequence of the rest of this License.

-countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright
-holder who places the Program under this License may add an explicit
-geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that
-distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such
-case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this
-License.
-
-9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
-of the General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be
-similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new
-problems or concerns.
-
-Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies
-a version number of this License which applies to it and "any later version",
-you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that
-version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If
-the Program does not specify a version number of this License, you may
-choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.
-
-10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs
-whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author to ask for
-permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software
-Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make
-exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of
-preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of
-promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.
-
-               NO WARRANTY
-
-11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE,
-THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT
-PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE
-STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
-OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT
-WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED,
-INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES
-OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
-PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND
-PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE
-PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL
-NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
-
-12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR
-AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR
-ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
-REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE
-LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL,
-SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES
-ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE
-PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA
-OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES
-SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE
-PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN
-IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF
-THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

-          END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
+If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
+any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
+apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
+circumstances.
+
+It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
+patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
+such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
+integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
+implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
+generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
+through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
+system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
+to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
+impose that choice.
+
+This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
+be a consequence of the rest of this License.
+
+  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
+certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
+original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
+may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
+those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
+countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
+the limitation as if written in the body of this License.
+
+  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
+of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
+be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
+address new problems or concerns.
+
+Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
+specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
+later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions
+either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
+Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of
+this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
+Foundation.
+
+  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
+programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
+to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
+Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
+make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
+of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
+of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.
+
+                            NO WARRANTY
+
+  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
+FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN
+OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
+PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
+OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
+MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS
+TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
+PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
+REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
+
+  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
+WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
+REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
+INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
+OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
+TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
+YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
+PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
+POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
+
+                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
+
+            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
+
+  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
+possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
+free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.
+
+  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
+to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
+convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
+the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
+
+    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
+    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>
+
+    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
+    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
+    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
+    (at your option) any later version.
+
+    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
+    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
+    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
+    GNU General Public License for more details.
+
+    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along
+    with this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc.,
+    51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA.
+
+Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
+
+If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
+when it starts in an interactive mode:
+
+    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author
+    Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
+    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
+    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.
+
+The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate
+parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may
+be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be
+mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.
+
+You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
+school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
+necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:
+
+  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program
+  `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.
+
+  <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1989
+  Ty Coon, President of Vice
+
+This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into
+proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may
+consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the
+library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General
+Public License instead of this License.

-GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
-
-              Version 2, June 1991
-
-Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc. 675 Mass Ave,
-Cambridge, MA 02139, USA. Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute
-verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
-
-                  Preamble
-
-The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to
-share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is
-intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to
-make sure the software is free for all its users. This General Public License
-applies to most of the Free Software Foundation's software and to any other
-program whose authors commit to using it. (Some other Free Software
-Foundation software is covered by the GNU Library General Public License
-instead.) You can apply it to your programs, too.
-
-When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our
-General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the
-freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if
-you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you
-can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that
-you know you can do these things.
-
-To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to
-deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These restrictions
-translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the
-software, or if you modify it.
-
-For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for
-a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have. You must make
-sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must show
-them these terms so they know their rights.
-
-We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2)
-offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute
-and/or modify the software.
-
-Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain that
-everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free software. If the
-software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients
-to know that what they have is not the original, so that any problems
-introduced by others will not reflect on the original authors' reputations.
-
-Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents. We
-wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will individually
-obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program proprietary. To prevent
-this, we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's
-free use or not licensed at all.
-
-The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification
-follow.
-
-           GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
- TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND
-               MODIFICATION
-
-0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice
-placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms
-of this General Public License. The "Program", below, refers to any such
-program or work, and a "work based on the Program" means either the
-Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work
-containing the Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with
-modifications and/or translated into another language. (Hereinafter, translation
-is included without limitation in the term "modification".) Each licensee is
-addressed as "you".
-
-Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered
-by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running the Program is
-not restricted, and the output from the Program is covered only if its contents
-constitute a work based on the Program (independent of having been made
-by running the Program). Whether that is true depends on what the Program
-does.
-
-1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source
-code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
-appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and
-disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License
-and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of the
-Program a copy of this License along with the Program.
-
-You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you
-may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
-
-2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it,
-thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such
-modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you
-also meet all of these conditions:
-
-a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that
-you changed the files and the date of any change.
-
-b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or in
-part contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof, to be
-licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this
-License.
-
-c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run,
-you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the most
-ordinary way, to print or display an announcement including an appropriate
-copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that
-you provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
-these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this License.
-(Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does not normally print such
-an announcement, your work based on the Program is not required to print
-an announcement.)
-
-These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable
-sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and can be
-reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then
-this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute
-them as separate works. But when you distribute the same sections as part
-of a whole which is a work based on the Program, the distribution of the
-whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other
-licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part
-regardless of who wrote it.
-
-Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to
-work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to
-control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the
-Program.

+   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
+
+  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains
+a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
+under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,
+refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"
+means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
+that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
+either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another

+Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.
+
+  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
+source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
+conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
+copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
+notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
+and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
+along with the Program.
+
+You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
+you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
+
+  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
+of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
+distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
+above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
+
+    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
+    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
+
+    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
+    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
+    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
+    parties under the terms of this License.
+
+    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
+    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
+    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
+    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
+    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
+    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
+    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
+    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
+    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
+    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)
+
+These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
+identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
+and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
+themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
+sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
+distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
+on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
+this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
+entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
+
+Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
+your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
+exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
+collective works based on the Program.
 
 In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
-with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a
-storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope
-of this License.
-
-3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under
-Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1
-and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:
-
-a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source
-code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above
-on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
-
-b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give
-any third party, for a charge no more than your cost of physically performing
-source distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of the corresponding
-source code, to be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on
-a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
-
-c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to distribute
-corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed only for
-noncommercial distribution and only if you received the program in object
-code or executable form with such an offer, in accord with Subsection b
-above.)
+with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
+a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
+the scope of this License.
+
+  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
+under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
+Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:
+
+    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
+    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
+    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
+
+    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
+    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
+    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
+    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
+    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
+    customarily used for software interchange; or,
+
+    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
+    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
+    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
+    received the program in object code or executable form with such
+    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)
 
 The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
-making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code
-means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated
-interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and
-installation of the executable. However, as a special exception, the source
-code distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in
-either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel,
-and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that
-component itself accompanies the executable.
-
-If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access to
-copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the
-source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source code,
-even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the
-object code.
-
-4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as
-expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy,
-modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically
-terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received
-copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
-terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.
-
-5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it.
-However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the
-Program or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you
-do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the
-Program (or any work based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance
-of this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying,
-distributing or modifying the Program or works based on it.
-
-6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
-Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original
-licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms and
-conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients'
-exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing
-compliance by third parties to this License.
-
-7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
-infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions
-are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that
-contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the
-conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy
-simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent
-obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Program at all.
-For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution
-of the Program by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through
-you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
+making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
+code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
+associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
+control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a
+special exception, the source code distributed need not include
+anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
+form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
+operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
+itself accompanies the executable.
+
+If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
+access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
+access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
+distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
+compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
+
+  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
+except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
+otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
+void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
+However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
+this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
+parties remain in full compliance.
+
+  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
+signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
+distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
+prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
+modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
+Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
+all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
+the Program or works based on it.
+
+  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
+Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
+original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
+these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
+restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
+You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
+this License.
+
+  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
+infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
+conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
+otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
+excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
+distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
+License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
+may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
+license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
+all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
+the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
 refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.

+
+            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
+
+  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
+possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
+free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.
+
+  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
+to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
+convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
+the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
+
+    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
+    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>
+
+    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
+    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
+    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
+    (at your option) any later version.
+
+    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
+    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
+    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
+    GNU General Public License for more details.
+
+    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along
+    with this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc.,
+    51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA.
+
+Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
+
+If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
+when it starts in an interactive mode:
+
+    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author
+    Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
+    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
+    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.
+
+The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate
+parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may
+be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be
+mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.
+
+You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
+school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
+necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:
+
+  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program
+  `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.
+
+  <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1989

+
+This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into
+proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may
+consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the
+library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General
+Public License instead of this License.

-GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
-
-              Version 2, June 1991
-
-Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc. 675 Mass Ave,
-Cambridge, MA 02139, USA. Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute
-verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
-
-                  Preamble
-
-The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to
-share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is
-intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to
-make sure the software is free for all its users. This General Public License
-applies to most of the Free Software Foundation's software and to any other
-program whose authors commit to using it. (Some other Free Software
-Foundation software is covered by the GNU Library General Public License
-instead.) You can apply it to your programs, too.
-
-When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our
-General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the
-freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if
-you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you
-can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that
-you know you can do these things.
-
-To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to
-deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These restrictions
-translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the
-software, or if you modify it.
-
-For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for
-a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have. You must make
-sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must show
-them these terms so they know their rights.
-
-We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2)
-offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute
-and/or modify the software.
-
-Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain that
-everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free software. If the
-software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients
-to know that what they have is not the original, so that any problems
-introduced by others will not reflect on the original authors' reputations.
-
-Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents. We
-wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will individually
-obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program proprietary. To prevent
-this, we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's
-free use or not licensed at all.
-
-The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification
-follow.
-
-           GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
- TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND
-               MODIFICATION
-
-0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice
-placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms
-of this General Public License. The "Program", below, refers to any such
-program or work, and a "work based on the Program" means either the
-Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work
-containing the Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with
-modifications and/or translated into another language. (Hereinafter, translation
-is included without limitation in the term "modification".) Each licensee is
-addressed as "you".
-
-Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered
-by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running the Program is
-not restricted, and the output from the Program is covered only if its contents
-constitute a work based on the Program (independent of having been made
-by running the Program). Whether that is true depends on what the Program
-does.
-
-1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source
-code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
-appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and
-disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License
-and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of the
-Program a copy of this License along with the Program.
-
-You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you
-may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
-
-2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it,
-thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such
-modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you
-also meet all of these conditions:
-
-a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that
-you changed the files and the date of any change.
-
-b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or in
-part contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof, to be
-licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this
-License.
-
-c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run,
-you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the most
-ordinary way, to print or display an announcement including an appropriate
-copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that
-you provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
-these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this License.
-(Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does not normally print such
-an announcement, your work based on the Program is not required to print
-an announcement.)
-
-These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable
-sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and can be
-reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then
-this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute
-them as separate works. But when you distribute the same sections as part
-of a whole which is a work based on the Program, the distribution of the
-whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other
-licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part
-regardless of who wrote it.
-
-Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to
-work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to
-control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the
-Program.

+                            Preamble
+
+  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
+freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
+License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
+software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
+General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
+Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
+using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
+the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
+your programs, too.
+
+  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
+price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
+have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
+this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
+if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
+in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.
+
+  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
+anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
+These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
+distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.
+
+  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
+gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
+you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
+source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
+rights.
+
+  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
+(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
+distribute and/or modify the software.
+
+  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
+that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
+software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
+want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
+that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
+authors' reputations.
+
+  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
+patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
+program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
+program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
+patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.
+
+  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
+modification follow.
+
+                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
+   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
+
+  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains
+a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
+under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,
+refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"
+means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
+that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
+either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
+language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
+the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".
+
+Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
+covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
+running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
+is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
+Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
+Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.
+
+  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
+source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
+conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
+copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
+notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
+and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
+along with the Program.
+
+You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
+you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
+
+  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
+of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
+distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
+above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
+
+    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
+    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
+
+    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
+    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
+    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
+    parties under the terms of this License.
+
+    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
+    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
+    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
+    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
+    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
+    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
+    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
+    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
+    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
+    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)
+
+These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
+identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
+and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
+themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
+sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
+distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
+on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
+this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
+entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
+
+Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
+your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
+exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
+collective works based on the Program.
 
 In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
-with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a
-storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope
-of this License.
-
-3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under
-Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1
-and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:
-
-a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source
-code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above
-on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
-
-b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give
-any third party, for a charge no more than your cost of physically performing
-source distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of the corresponding
-source code, to be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on
-a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
-
-c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to distribute
-corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed only for
-noncommercial distribution and only if you received the program in object
-code or executable form with such an offer, in accord with Subsection b
-above.)
+with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
+a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
+the scope of this License.
+
+  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
+under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
+Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:
+
+    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
+    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
+    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
+
+    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
+    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
+    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
+    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
+    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
+    customarily used for software interchange; or,
+
+    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
+    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
+    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
+    received the program in object code or executable form with such
+    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)
 
 The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
-making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code
-means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated
-interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and
-installation of the executable. However, as a special exception, the source
-code distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in
-either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel,
-and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that
-component itself accompanies the executable.
-
-If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access to
-copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the
-source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source code,
-even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the
-object code.
-
-4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as
-expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy,
-modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically
-terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received
-copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
-terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.
-
-5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it.
-However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the
-Program or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you
-do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the
-Program (or any work based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance
-of this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying,
-distributing or modifying the Program or works based on it.
-
-6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
-Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original
-licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms and
-conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients'
-exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing
-compliance by third parties to this License.
-
-7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
-infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions
-are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that
-contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the
-conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy
-simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent
-obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Program at all.
-For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution
-of the Program by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through
-you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
+making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
+code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
+associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
+control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a
+special exception, the source code distributed need not include
+anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
+form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
+operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
+itself accompanies the executable.
+
+If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
+access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
+access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
+distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
+compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
+
+  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
+except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
+otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
+void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
+However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
+this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
+parties remain in full compliance.
+
+  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
+signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
+distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
+prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
+modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
+Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
+all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
+the Program or works based on it.
+
+  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
+Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
+original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
+these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
+restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
+You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
+this License.
+
+  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
+infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
+conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
+otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
+excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
+distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
+License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
+may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
+license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
+all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
+the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
 refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.
 
-If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
-particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply and
-the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.
-
-It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or
-other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this
-section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software
-distribution system, which is implemented by public license practices. Many
-people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software
-distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
-system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to
-distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose
-that choice.
-
-This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a
-consequence of the rest of this License.
-
-8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in certain
-countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright
-holder who places the Program under this License may add an explicit
-geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that
-distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such
-case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this
-License.
-
-9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
-of the General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be
-similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new
-problems or concerns.
-
-Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies
-a version number of this License which applies to it and "any later version",
-you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that
-version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If
-the Program does not specify a version number of this License, you may
-choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.
-
-10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs
-whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author to ask for
-permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software
-Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make
-exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of
-preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of
-promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.
-
-               NO WARRANTY
-
-11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE,
-THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT
-PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE
-STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
-OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT
-WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED,
-INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES
-OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
-PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND
-PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE
-PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL
-NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
-
-12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR
-AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR
-ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
-REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE
-LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL,
-SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES
-ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE

+
+            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
+
+  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
+possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
+free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.
+
+  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
+to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
+convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
+the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
+
+    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
+    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>
+
+    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
+    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
+    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
+    (at your option) any later version.
+
+    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
+    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
+    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
+    GNU General Public License for more details.
+
+    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along
+    with this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc.,
+    51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA.
+
+Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
+
+If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
+when it starts in an interactive mode:
+
+    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author
+    Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
+    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
+    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.
+
+The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate
+parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may
+be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be
+mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.
+
+You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
+school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
+necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:
+
+  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program
+  `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.
+
+  <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1989
+  Ty Coon, President of Vice
+
+This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into
+proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may
+consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the
+library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General
+Public License instead of this License.
